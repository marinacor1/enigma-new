# enigma-new

Simple project using object oriented programming that uses the logic that Turing used to solve the encryption problem in World War II.

The premise is:
## To encrypt
Take a message, convert it into numbers, add each number by a specific rotation amount.  Convert these new numbers back to text. This is the encrypted message.
